You need cmake v2.8, make and gcc

From folder with project:
```
    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake ..
    make
    ./game (on Linux)
```

Or just run `build.sh`

*On Windows*

Need Visual Studio and C++ Cmake tools for Windows - part **Desktop development with C++** and **Linux Development with C++** workloads:

1. File -> Open folder
2. Select folder "tictactoe-terminal"

Or, you can use `tictactoe.cbp` for CodeBlocks (tested on v20.03)
